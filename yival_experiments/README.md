# How to run experiment

## 1. install automation-api library

``` shell
cd /path/to/gapminder-ai/automation-api
poetry install
```

## 2. enable poetry shell

``` shell
poetry shell
```

## 3. copy .env and fetch questions

``` shell
cd ../yival_experiment/
cp ../automation-api/.env ./

python fetch_question.py
```

This will fetch all enabled questions in the AI eval spreadsheet and create data/questions.csv.

Note: I tried to create a custom data reader to read data from AI eval
spreadsheet directly, but then yival failed to run the experiment. I
checked and found that Yival requires a dataset to have a local
file when the source type is set to "dataset". So we need to fetch it first.

(Maybe, we can solve it by changing the source type to "machine generated")

## 4. run the experiment

The full experiment configuration is [here](https://github.com/Gapminder/gapminder-ai/blob/yival/yival_experiments/latest_experiment.yaml)

To run it:

``` shell
yival run --output ./output/experiment_name experiment_latest.yaml
# You can replace experiment_name with other names.
```

This will output a pickle file in `output/experiment_name_0.pkl` which include all Experiment Results objects.

When the experiment is completed, Yival will start a web server to show the results.

## 5. generate a result csv from output

To convert the pickle to excel file and create csv files for summary report, you can run the script in output/.

``` shell
cd output
python generate_result.py
```

This will generate `results.xlsx`, `result_comb_prompt.csv`, and `result_comb.csv` files in the output directory.

TODO: We can add a custom evaluator in Yival to calculate the final scores.
