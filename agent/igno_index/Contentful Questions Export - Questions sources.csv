32,In which countries are people on average least sat,In which countries are people on average least satisfied with their lives?,Multiple sources,"There are many ways to measure happiness and it is a difficult thing to measure because it is a temporary feeling and also somewhat subjective. Our World in Data has looked at multiple sources and measures[1]. 

Perhaps the best way is the “cantril ladder question”, where people are asked where they feel they are on a ladder from 0 to 10, where 10 is the best possible life and 0 is the worst possible life for them. This is used in many surveys, for example in the Gallup World Poll which is used in the World Happiness report[2]. 

A slightly different format is used in two other surveys. In the World Value Survey[3] people are asked if they are very happy, quite happy, not very happy, or not happy at all. In the European Commission’s Eurobarometer[4] people are asked if they are very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied or not at all satisfied with life. 

Asking about life satisfaction and happiness is not exactly the same thing, as self-reported happiness has both an experiential and emotional side. However, there is some crossover between the two types of questions and both give similar results in terms of people in richer countries having both higher life satisfaction and happiness.

72,Population living in another country,"In 1990, 3% of the world’s population lived in a different country than where they were born. What is that share today?",Data source: UN International Migrant Stock (2020),"This data comes from the UN International Migrant Stock (2024)[1] and uses mostly census data, equating international migrants with the foreign-born population whenever possible. The percentage of the total population that lived in another country than the one they were born in was 3.7% in 2024. 

In most countries that lacked data on place of birth, information on the country of citizenship was available and was used as the basis for the identification of international migrants. 
In these cases, equating international migrants with foreign citizens (this was for 46 of the countries or areas). 
There are some drawbacks with this: People who were born in the country of residence may be included in the number of international migrants even though they may have never lived abroad. Also, people who were born abroad and who naturalized in their country of residence are excluded from the stock of international migrants when using citizenship to define international migrants.

The UN says coverage of refugees in population censuses is uneven. In countries where refugees have been granted refugee status and allowed to integrate, they are normally covered by the population census as any other international migrant. However, in many countries, refugees lack freedom of movement and are required to reside in camps or other designated areas. In these cases, population censuses may ignore refugees. When it comes to undocumented immigrants, they may or may not be included depending on the country. 

No matter how you count, the number of 4% will be much closer to the truth than any of the other alternatives.

There is potential for the number to be higher than 115, because this data only counts plant material stored in medium or long-term facilities and because not all countries report to the FAO each year. 
For example, China is listed as having no plant accessions in their labs, even though the China National Genebank houses  “The Living Database of Animal and Plant Resources”[4].

This data does not take into account the quality or security of the genebanks and the level of risk of losing gene samples within the bank.

Military operations aim to protect populations against threats and contribute to a secure environment. Policing is central in preventing, mitigating and resolving violent conflict and contributing to early peacebuilding and reconciliation. Uniformed personnel are contributed and deployed under several different types of arrangements.”

The latest ones we used are from January 2025, and show that Bangladesh (5,689), India (5,375), Nepal (5,942), Rwanda (5,897) and Ethiopia (1,533) each contribute over ten times more troops to UN missions than the UK (268), Germany (194) and South Korea (540) and more than a hundred times more than the US (21) and Switzerland (22).

According to the UN: ""Peacekeeping soldiers are paid by their own Governments according to their own national rank and salary scale. Countries volunteering uniformed personnel to peacekeeping operations are reimbursed by the UN at a standard rate, approved by the General Assembly, of US$1,428 per soldier per month as of 1 July 2019.

""Police and other civilian personnel are paid from the peacekeeping budgets established for each operation.

""The UN also reimburses Member States for providing equipment, personnel and support services to military or police contingents.""

The report uses data from the FAO and Global Forest Watch. It is, the authors say, the first analysis of tropical rainforest ever done.

The figures from 100 years ago rely on estimates and cannot be considered exact. Indeed, among the six independent experts we contacted about this question, there were various disagreements and skepticism about the figures  Rainforest Foundation Norway uses. Counting trees is notoriously difficult and subject to different definitions and counting. However, there was little argument that - of the three options used in the question - “more than 30%” was more correct than the other two options.

UNHCR acknowledges the difficulties of accurately monitoring the size of refugee populations throughout the world, such as the varying definitions of ‘refugee’ and the varying quality of records throughout the world. 

The bigger issue with this figure is that it only measures enrollment in primary education, not the quality of the education. In some places the education offered to refugees has been criticized for being of a lower standard than the rest of the country. 

Lastly, there is only data for registered refugees. This means that there are potentially displaced people who - for a number of reasons - are not legally registered and recognized as being refugees and so who are not included in the 65% estimate.

69,"Worldwide, what share of refugees have been in exile for more than four years?","Of all refugees worldwide, in 2024, what share had been in exile for more than four years?
",Source: UNHCR,"UNHCR defines a protracted refugee situation as one in which 25,000 or more refugees from the same nationality have been in exile for at least five consecutive years in a given host country. Therefore, it doesn’t include groups who may have been in exile for more than five years but whose numbers do not reach 25,000. Also, if people return home or new people join their countrymen in exile, they still count in the figures of those who are in exile, so the definition does not then take into account the situation of individual refugees. If we say that 25,000 people from one country have been in another country for 25 years, it doesn’t mean all of those 25,000 have been there that entire time.
Despite the limitations of the data, the four independent experts we spoke to considered it a good measure of long-term refugee situations and agreed that our correct answer was indeed correct.

1676,compare refugee spendings in Europe vs World ,"In 2022, the UN spent around $6.4 billion to help refugees worldwide. How much did Western European governments spend to help refugees within West Europe?","Source: UNHCR and OECD, via Gapminder","For spending by Western European governments, $21 billion is the lowest estimate as that is only counting the money spent on refugees inside the donor country in the first year of arrival. In  some countries it probably represents most of the spending, but in others (like Belgium and Germany), these expenses are only a part of the spending, considering the amount of refugees that were helped and the comparably high living costs. In the spreadsheet below we compare data from OECD reports, Allocated Aid Money vs. Cost of living multiplied with the number of refugees, taking into consideration their employment rates. The cost-based calculation indicates that the true spending is probably closer to $29 billion. 

To get the UN spending Gapminder calculated the figure based on data from UNHCR, UNRWA and OECD.
The total spending by the UN is the sum of UNHCR and [UNRWA pledges](https://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/list_of_2022_pledges_by_all_donors.pdf)  reported in 2022, subtracting UNHCR’s spending on internally displaced people (IDP) as they are not international refugees. The UNHCR spent funding for 2022 (minus roughly 16% for IDP) was around $5 billion. UNRWA had two sources of income, pledges and [UN core funding to UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/2020-2021_programme_budget_blue_book.pdf) : $1.17 billion + $0.033 bilion = $1.2 billion.

This data comes from many different governmental, international, national, and regional agencies and is collected by the WDPA. All data must meet the WDPA standards which includes having spatial data, and uses the IUCN definition of a protected area[2]:
“A protected area is a clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values.”

While there has been a big increase in countries’ protected marine areas, the speed of growth is not the same for international water, beyond countries’ borders and interest zones. Such areas of international water cover around 60% of all oceans around the world. But, in total, no matter how you measure, the share of the ocean that is protected is clearly increasing.

We spoke to six individual experts who all recommended the WDPA as the source to use for this data. However, they did warn that just because the share of protected areas has increased it does not mean that the most important ecosystems or areas of biodiversity are included in these areas, or that the areas that are under protection are protected at a continually high standard.

The term ""known reserves"" we use in this question is called ""proved reserves"" in the BP data. Proved (or known) reserves are  ""those quantities that geological and engineering information indicates with reasonable certainty can be recovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic and geological conditions."" There are more resources that are known about but, with the current technology, don't meet the criteria of ""proved reserves"" that can actually be used.

This list is updated every three years and is based upon per capita income.

OECD statistics are the only source of official, verified and comparable data on aid reported by 30 members of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and about 80 other providers of development cooperation, including other countries, multilateral organizations and private foundations.

For private philantropies and charities, the OECD DAC statistics includes project-level information from 33 of the largest foundations working for development. These foundations report data on their grant making and programme-related investments (PRIs) for development following the same statistical standards and definitions as ODA.

In our calculations [2] we have imported the data on aid by different sectors (DAC & NON-DAC countries, private donors, charities & philanthropies) and total aid by recipient/destination. We then compiled aid given to the least developed countries and calculated the share of charities and philanthropies as a percentage of total aid.  

It is more difficult to track private aid than it is for aid supplied by governmental agencies, and this data only looks at the largest 33 private aid givers, so it is likely that not all private aid is accounted for in this data.

There is a high level of uncertainty in the data for countries where the ILO have used estimates due to a lack of recorded data. It likely misses people employed in the informal sector too. That lack of data about the informal sector means the actual share working in manufacturing is likely lower than 15%.

The figures we use for this question come from the WWF’s and ZSL's Living Planet Index and it looks at nearly 32,000 populations of 5,230 species between 1970 and 2018. The data comes from results published by others, as the Living Planet Index has none of its own data collectors. For that reason, the species and study areas are not fully representative of all vertebrate species or areas (e.g. there are a lot of birds surveyed and a lot of surveys in North America and Europe compared to other continents). The 69% average given is within an uncertainty range of between 63% and 75%. And, as discussed above, it is vital to recognize that figure is an average across all of the animals surveyed. Some will have declined more and some would have had an increasing number. Despite these shortcomings, two independent experts we consulted for this question consider the Living Planet Index as a reliable source and that our correct answer is the best figure available.

One alternative is the Sea Around Us - a project from the university of British Columbia - which has been working to replace the “missing data” that exists in the FAO numbers, which they believe comes from unreported catch numbers. The Sea Around Us’ numbers are quite a bit higher than those reported by the FAO, but the trend when it comes to overfishing is very similar (actually higher today, at around 40-50%). The figure of 1% of fish stocks being overfished in the 1950s actually comes from the Sea Around Us, so we are confident it is not an underestimation (even though it doesn’t take into account fish stocks that may have been overfished in the decades before they started counting.)

1717,CO2 in Lower MIC vs HIC,"Countries with incomes like India, Morocco and Bolivia, emit how much CO2 per person, compared to high-income countries?",Source: Global Carbon Project ,"Gapminder has calculated the average of different income groups[1], based on data for Consumption Emissions of CO2 from the Global Carbon Project [2].
Those are consumption-based emissions in 2020, inventories allocate emissions to products that are consumed within a country and are conceptually calculated as the territorial emissions minus the “embodied” territorial emissions to produce exported products plus the emissions in other countries to produce imported products (consumption is equal to territorial minus exports plus imports). Million Tonnes of CO2 per capita 

We can also do the same calculation with Production CO2 emissions data from Climate Watch Historical GHG emissions via World Bank [3]. With these data, the lower-middle-income countries have an average of 1.5 tonnes per person, which is 83% lower than high-income Countries with 8.7 tonne per person.

79,Future Megacity population,Megacities are cities with more than 10 million inhabitants. What share of the world's population is expected to live in megacities in 2030?,Source:  UN - World Urbanization Prospects 2018,"These numbers are projections, so of course they can’t be considered perfect. Things may change in the coming years, but it is unlikely that in the next decade tens of millions of people will move from smaller cities to big ones. According to the UN in 2020, 557 million people lived in 34 cities with more than 10 million inhabitants. That is7.1% of the world’s population of 7.8 billion. 

The UN estimate could potentially be a bit too low, as there is no international standard for defining city boundaries when counting citizens. If the more generous methods that include sparsely populated outskirts were used everywhere, then a few more cities would maybe qualify as megacities. Despite that legitimate concern, most cities are not even close to 10 million people. The UN projects that the number of megacities will grow from 34 to 43 by 2030, but the people living in them will still only make up 8.8% of the global population. The number of cities with more than one million inhabitants will at the same time increase from a total of 579 to 706.

Because of the uncertainty of projections, we put huge differences between the three answer options safe in the knowledge that the two wrong answers couldn’t possibly be correct unless there is an unprecedented migration of billions of people from small cities to large cities in the next 10 years.

11,"In 1990, 58% of the world's population lived in lo","In 1990, 58% of the world's population lived in low-income countries. What is the share today?",Sources: World Bank & UN,"This is based on the World Bank’s definition[1] of low-income countries based on their Gross National Income (GNI) per capita. Countries belong to the group if their income falls below a specific threshold, which increases slightly over the years, almost keeping pace with the inflation of the US dollar.

In 1990, there were 53 countries below the threshold which was then $610. The total population of those countries was 3.1 billion, which was 58% of the world population of 5.3 billion, based on the population estimates from the UN Population Division[2]. In 2022, the threshold for being labeled as a low-income country had risen to $1,135 or less [3] when only 26 countries had average incomes below that, and their combined population was 0.7 billion people, which is 9% of the world population of 8 billion. 

There were 53 countries that were low-income in 1990. Today there are 26. Many countries have moved to a higher income but some dropped down to low-income from previously being middle-income countries (including Yemen and Syria).

The unit used for these GNI numbers is US Dollars converted from national currencies with the so-called Atlas method [4], which uses the average exchange rate of the three recent years. This method of converting currencies doesn’t account for price differences and purchasing power differences between countries. And national averages don’t express the income inequalities within countries which have been increasing in all these countries, as the income growth has been very unevenly distributed among the population. No matter what, a majority of people today have higher incomes than the majority in these countries had in 1990[5].

According to the ILO and UNICEF, worldwide, 222 million children between 5 and 17 years are in employment. 160 million of those children are used as child labor. Almost half of them, 79 million, work in hazardous child labor [1]. An estimated 70% of the 160 million work in agriculture, which includes fishing, forestry, livestock herding and aquaculture, and comprises both subsistence and commercial farming. 20% work in Services, and 10% in the Industrial sector, including mining. 

It is of course difficult to accurately estimate global levels of child labor and there are competing definitions[2]. However, the three independent experts we have spoke to trust the ILO’s data and have no doubt that the agriculture sector is responsible for the largest share of child labor.

4,What share of the population in high-income countr,What share of the population in high-income countries (like Germany and the USA) live in extreme poverty (with less than $2/day)?,Source: World Bank,"The World Bank[1] estimates that in 2022 roughly 0.3% of all people in high-income countries lived on less than $2.15 a day. The dollar level is adjusted for differences in prices and costs of living, by using the Purchasing Power Parity of 2011 international dollars.
The group called high-income countries in 2022 were those who had a gross national income (GNI) per capita above $13,846 or more, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method[2]. Around 80 countries from around the world are in this category, including most countries in Europe.
The incomes of people in different high-income countries are made comparable in the Luxembourg Income Study database[3].
Please note that this question asks about the international extreme poverty rate, which uses an absolute poverty line of 1.90 $/day (we say ""less than $2"" a day in the question just to make the question more simple). This is different from the national poverty lines which vary across countries and are used to determine who is eligible for social welfare programs in each country. In many high-income countries the national poverty lines are around 20 times higher than the international line of extreme poverty[4].

Of the total estimated species, only 8% have been evaluated by the Red List. Among the evaluated species, 41% of the 8,009 evaluated amphibians were threatened. Among the 5,991 evaluated mammal species, 27% were threatened, and 12% of the 11,195 evaluated birds were threatened. But the uncertainties are high.

The Red List uses a variety of criteria to assess the threatened state of an animal, and focuses on the worst-case scenario, potentially overestimating the level of threat. Some have argued that the criteria may be subjective and different biologists interpret them differently. The decisions are secretive and there are political motivations to listing a species as more or less threatened than it actually is.

Some of the observed differences across the groups may be a consequence of biased selection of which species get evaluated in the different groups. The difference is still large enough to assume that amphibians are more theatened than birds and mammals. We asked five independent experts to provide feedback about this, and they all agreed that these Red List estimates are the most reliable numbers that exist.

It is compiled through surveys and, where data is missing, from estimates. Some countries’ numbers may be overestimates and others are underestimates, for example there is often an underrepresentation of rural communities where Internet access might be lower, resulting in our number being an overestimation. On the other hand, data can be slow to come in from low-income settings where progress right now is the fastest, and the number we have might therefore also be an underestimation. Finally, the ITU’s definition of using the Internet is being online once in the previous three months. If someone was only online once or twice in that time, that is clearly very different from the constant connection many of us have. Despite these limitations, two independent experts we consulted considered the ITU’s figures the best and most reliable estimate of how many people use the Internet.

The WHO estimates are based mainly on data from national administrative records and household surveys, such as the Expanded Programme on Immunization cluster survey, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). These surveys assess the vaccination coverage among children aged 12-23 who received a vaccination anytime before the survey. In 2023, an estimated 87% of 1-year olds got at least one vaccine.

Gapminder has compiled the estimates on the percentage of 1-year-old children who received nine different vaccinations (Haemophilus influenzae type B, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, tuberculosis BCG, measles, pneumococcal disease, poliomyelitis and rotavirus) for the period 1980-2021 for countries and territories and average global immunization coverage [2].

8,Biologists have evaluated the status of more than ,"Biologists have evaluated the status of more than 160,000 species of plants and animals. How many are endangered or threatened?",Source: IUCN Red List,"Of the total estimated species, only 8% have been evaluated by the Red List, meaning we can’t know for sure what the number would be if all known species were evaluated, and we absolutely don’t know what the number is for all the species that are not yet discovered. But we can clearly see that the public are wrong about the rate of threatened species among those that are evaluated.

As of December 2024, the IUCN had assessed the threatened status of 166,061 species and of those 46,337 were classified as threatened (either critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable), which gives a percentage of 28%. (Those numbers also include fungi and protists, which are neither plants nor animals.)

The Red List uses a variety of criteria to assess the threatened status of a species, and focuses on the worst-case scenario, potentially overestimating the level of threat. The criteria are somewhat subjective and the decisions are secretive and in some cases there are political motivations to listing a species as more or less threatened than it is. Also, we humans tend to focus on where the problems are, so potentially when evaluating species for the Red List, those that are most endangered are being evaluated first, which would lead to 28% potentially being an overestimation, but nobody knows for sure.

Even if different experts would assess the status of the same species differently, the 150,000 is such a large number that the disagreements would probably go in both directions. And even if 28% is probably an overestimation, it is definitely  “more right” than the other options of this question, which was confirmed by four independent biologists who we asked for feedback.

It showed that there were 10.6 million overweight under 5s in Africa. The global total was 38.9 million, which means Africa represented 27% of the world total. The data is taken from nationally representative household surveys which are done infrequently (typically every 3 to 5 years) and then compiled into a report jointly produced by UNICEF, the WHO and World Bank. This report was published in May 2021. Because of the Coronavirus pandemic, all of the figures that were then modeled came from before 2020 and do not take into account the impacts of the Coronavirus pandemic. The big differences between the three answer options here guarantee that even if this figure underestimates the issue, we still have a large enough margin for the two wrong answers to not possibly be correct.

80,Homeless from natural disasters,"Since 1990, roughly 2.5 million people were made temporarily homeless in Europe due to natural disasters. The number for Asia during the same period was...","Source: EM-DAT, International Disaster Database","There is some disagreement as to what constitutes a natural disaster which can make estimates vary between countries and regions. Similar issues also apply to historical data where what was known about the disasters impose limitations. 

Conflict is another factor that can affect the number of people made homeless but they’re not always included in these disaster estimates. Homeless in the context of our question refers to the number of people whose house is destroyed or heavily damaged and therefore need shelter after an event. It can be difficult to estimate how many are made homeless by an event, i.e. who were homeless prior to a disaster and what is still considered a home afterwards may affect the numbers.

The economic and infrastructure impact from these disasters might not be the same between Europe and Asia. Within Asia there are big regional differences in how the disasters have impacted societies. Unsurprisingly, countries at a higher income level are often more resilient when hit by disasters.

One of the biggest disasters that left people in Europe temporarily homeless, was the 1997 Central European flood that impacted mostly Poland and Czech Republic and where 62 000 people were left homeless. In Asia, meanwhile, severe floods at times left millions of people homeless, for instance during the 1998 China floods, where 15 million people were left homeless in the Hubei province in China by extreme floods caused by prolonged heavy rains.

Despite the limitations of the database, four independent experts we consulted for this question say they regarded EM-DAT as a reliable source and there was no doubt that more people in Asia are impacted by natural disasters.

The countries in which residents were least likely to say they feel safe walking alone at night were mostly countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa. 

Defining peace, safety, or security is a very difficult thing, but the data we used for this question is used by the UN to monitor SDG 16.1.4 and was recommended to us by two independent experts. 

As with any average, it hides big differences between countries and there are limitations to the data. One key point is that the figures are just talking about people's feelings of safety, rather than diving into the topics of crime statistics and security and peace rankings of a country. Also, Gallup states in their methodology that they do not survey in areas where the safety of the interviewing is threatened. This obviously impacts a survey about how safe people feel in different areas.

However, in recent years, there have been more attempts to quantify these figures and they have lowered the original estimates. Originally, our correct answer was ""less than 6%"" but due to to more recent papers, we have reduced the correct answer to ""less than 1%"".

According to estimates from the OECD in 2022, around 82 million tonnes of the 350 million tonnes of plastic waste produced in a year is mismanaged. Of that, around 1.7 million tonnes ends up in the ocean (this is 0.5% of the total).

New surveys of ocean plastics are planned and we will probably have more certain numbers within the coming years.[3]

Roughly 90% of the world’s population had some access to the electricity grid in their countries in 2022 according to The Energy Progress Report, which tracks the progress of SDG 7 [1].

The term “access” is defined differently in all their underlying sources. In some extreme cases, households may experience an average of 60 power outages per week and still be listed as “having access to electricity”. The question, accordingly, talks about “some” access. 

Global averages hide regional differences. In many areas, basically everyone has access to electricity, while in Sub-Saharan Africa only 51% of the population does[1]. It is also much more common to have access to some electricity in cities where, worldwide, 98% have electricity, compared to those living in the countryside where only 84% have access to electricity.

Poore and T. Nemecek calculated the share of food that is transported internationally using data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) 2013 food balance sheets. They had a figure of 17%. We used their calculations as a template using 2019 FAO data and that is how we got the same figure of 17kg of every 100kg of food produced being transported internationally (It had actually increased to 18% in 2017 but has gone back to 17kg again). FAO data is reported by each country and as such the accuracy varies. If you focus on the share of calories from food transported internationally rather than the number of kgs, the answer will be higher than 17%, closer to [23%](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2014EF000250), but this is still far lower than the wrong options to our question, which were 37% and 57%, which most people guessed.

High-income countries, for example, rely a great deal on extraction of raw materials from other countries (up to 40%), but this is included in their material footprint as imports.

UN Stats gets the data from the International Resource Panel, a global science-policy platform established by the United Nations Environment Programme in 2007 [2].

""ALA compiles data on book challenges from reports filed with its Office for Intellectual Freedom by library professionals in the field and from news stories published throughout the United States.

Of those challenges, 48% related to books in public libraries, 41% to school libraries, 10% to schools and 1% to higher education libraries and other institutions. Despite the limitations of the data, three independent experts confirmed that it was the most reliable source for this data and we should not hesitate to use it.

10,How many companies in the world have a woman as to,How many companies in the world have a woman as top manager or CEO?,Multiple data sources...,"According to the Enterprise Survey[1] by the World Bank[1], some 18% of businesses had a female CEO. In another, recent study by Grant Thornton “Women in business 2024”[2], the estimate is 33%, which is a rapid increase from their 19% estimate for 2016. But their estimate is far from globally representative, as it’s based on interviews in just 28 countries.
To avoid overstating progress, we use the estimate 18% from the World Bank as our correct answer. This is based on interviews conducted during the period 2009 to 2020 with tens of thousands of businesses with 5 or more employees in the manufacturing and service sectors in 144 countries. Firms with 100% government/state ownership are not included. The number of businesses per country ranges from 150 in small countries, to nearly 2000 in large countries. Because the data is based on a small sample of all companies in the world, there is a large margin of error which we take into consideration by putting big differences between the correct answer 18%, and the two wrong options: 10% and 2%. The World Bank’s trends have also been rising steadily, why it’s reasonable to believe that the real number would be higher than 18% if a new round of interviews were conducted today.

According to three independent studies[3][4][5] of companies in lots of countries, it seems like businesses with female CEOs on average outperform business with male CEOs. Please note that all studies clearly state that the finding doesn’t necessarily show a causal relationship of higher or lower profits is caused by the CEO’s gender. It’s just as likely that the explanation is a kind of company culture which leads to selecting a female CEO and that such a company culture also is a more profitable company culture. A company with such culture can also be as profitable with a male CEO.

But this data problem doesn’t influence the global number much, as most of the value is generated in middle- and high-income countries, where data is of higher quality, and in high-income countries, only around 1% of GDP comes from the combined value of agriculture, fishing and forestry. 

Over the last 200 years, most countries increased their incomes and as they did they have followed very similar declines of agriculture as a share of their economies[3].

13,What share of the world’s population lives in mega,What share of the world’s population lives in megacities (cities with at least 10 million people)?,Source: UN - The World’s Cities 2018,"According to the UN[1] in 2020, 557 million people lived in 34 cities with more than 10 million inhabitants. That is 7.1% of the world's population of 7.8 billion. But in this question we use 8% as the correct answer to make sure we are not understating the number, as so many believe it is much higher. The UN estimate could potentially be a bit too low, as there is no international standard for defining city boundaries when counting citizens. The UN report mixes methods used by different countries. If the more generous methods that include sparsely populated outskirts were used everywhere, then a few more cities would maybe qualify as megacities.
Despite that legitimate concern, most cities are not even close to 10 million people, so even adding a couple of more million extra people to most cities wouldn’t make a big difference to the number of megacities.
However, we chose to put the correct answer as 8% to try to take into account any data concerns about underestimation of city size. Even if the number of megacities and their population sizes are increasing, it will probably not reach 8% for many years. The UN[1] projects that the number of megacities will grow from 34 to 43 by 2030, but the people living in them will still only make up 8.8% of the global population. Of all urban dwellers then, an even larger share will live in cities that are not megacities.

19,High-income gov revenue from customs,The governments of high-income countries get how much of their revenue from customs and import duties?,Sources: UNU WIDER and World Bank,"On average, import taxes as a share of government revenue is somewhere between 1.8 % and 2.3 %, so we use “around 2%” as a proxy. Probably this number is even lower than 1.8%  but because no single source gives an exact number and it also varies between countries and over years, a number of 2% is reasonable to avoid understating it.

Gapminder estimated import taxes as share of government revenue in high-income countries based on revenue data published by UNU WIDER[1] and the World Bank[2][3]. The data from WIDER includes all trade taxes, including export taxes which are so small that we simply ignored them. For a detailed methodology, see [4].

We use the definition of high-income countries from the World Bank[5].
Many governments of the oil rich states in the Gulf Cooperation Council[6] have lots of income from oil revenue to finance their expenditures. Oil revenue accounted for between 50% and 90% of their total government revenues during 2012–2015.

We double-checked our calculations against [this report](https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/revenue-statistics-highlights-brochure.pdf) from the OECD and we also collected feedback from two independent researchers of finance and macroeconomics, who confirmed they consider our correct answer to be reliable.

More recently Air temperatures are estimated across the world and therefore the energy captured in air can be calculated. Temperatures at different ocean depths have always been trickier to gather. Historic data came mainly from Nansen[4] bottles until the 1950’s when bathythermographs[5] started being used.

During the last 20 years temperatures down to 2000 meters have been measured with small ARGO[3] floats which have covered almost all parts of the oceans since 2005. The ARGO floats sink to 2000 meters depth and then return to the surface to report their measurements. You can see the latest data from almost 4000 of them in real time on the Argovis map[6]. Ship-based stations still dominate when measuring below 2000 meters, but recently the Deep ARGO floats started collecting temperatures all the way down to 6000 meters, in really deep water basins where no historic measurements exist.

12,What share of the world’s population don't have en,What share of the world’s population don't have enough food to meet their daily energy needs?,Source: UN,"The estimates of undernourishment in 2022 are far from exact, and the increase of 120 million hungry people during the Corona Pandemic is very hard to know for sure [1]. But even if the correct answer 11% is just an estimate, the wrong options are definitely not correct.

We have checked these assumptions against three different methods to estimate hunger based on three different kinds of data: 1. Available food, 2. Body weights and heights of children, 3. Extreme poverty. Each of  these datasets have large uncertainties, but the estimates for wasted children (7% in 2022) and extreme poverty (8.3% in 2022) are both lower than 11%, which indicates that hunger is probably in that range, and certainly not as high as the wrong option to this question of 23%.
FAO[1] estimates the number of hungry people based on the number of calories available in each country each year, as documented in food balance sheets. These calories are then assumed to be purchased by the population based on the income of people, which in 2022 results in a rough estimate of the number of people who couldn’t afford enough food of 9.2% of the world population.

One measure of child malnutrition is wasting: the share of children with low body weight for height (indicating thinness). In 2022 the global wasting number was 7% of all children under age five, according to UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank [2]. This estimate indicates how many families who often experience food shortage.

The number of people in extreme poverty, with less than $1.90/day (later changed to $2.15/day in October 2022), was 8.3% in 2022, according to the World Bank[3], calculated from data based on household income surveys from recent years and taking into account the corona pandemic effect.

is built and land which is used for other purposes, such as agricultural production. It also includes any other structures built on land to meet permanent purposes. Legal frameworks commonly use the terms ‘immovable property’ or ‘real property’ when referring to land.

This data comes from the World Bank and it relates to SDG indicator 5.a.2: “Proportion of countries where the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women’s equal rights to land ownership and/or control.”

This data is collected by sending questionnaires to over 2,000 legal experts specialized in family, labour and criminal law, and members of civil society organizations working on gender issues. Respondents answer questionnaires and references to relevant laws and regulations. The Women, Business and the Law team of the World Bank collects the texts of these sources of national law - constitutions, codes, laws, statutes, rules, regulations, and procedures - and checks questionnaire responses for accuracy.

1500,Unpaid work women,"Across the world, women do more unpaid care and domestic work than men. How much more?",Source: UN,"We use the UN as our source for this question. The figures they use come from time-use surveys where people report how many minutes they spend on different tasks. 
However, some of the data the UN uses for some countries is 20 years old and it only covers 88 countries. As the UN says: “The gender gap in unpaid care and domestic work is at its widest in the Northern Africa and Western Asia region, where the median female-to-male ratio is almost six. The gender inequalities do not disappear in high-income countries, but they are not as glaring.”
Experts we consulted on this question agreed that, despite how old some of the data is, little has changed when it comes to the share of this work. We also contacted the people who do a different survey (the Multinational Time Use Study), who agreed that the correct answer we give is also similar to what they have concluded from their own surveys.

This figure will change as elections are held, but the 25% average figure has been steady over the past 24 months we have been working on this question. We chose to have an average across both chambers of parliament despite the upper houses having different levels of power in different countries. For example, the upper house in the UK (House of Lords) is unelected and has little power. But, the upper house in the US (the Senate) has a lot of power. So we chose to have an average across both worldwide. The number will keep changing slightly, so will need to be updated regularly. It’s worth noting that being represented in the parliament does not automatically transfer into female contribution and engagement as there sometimes can be other obstacles.

What happened to the rural population?",Source: UN,"Different countries have very different definitions of what is urban and what is rural, for instance how many people need to live in a village for it to be urban and not rural? The UN uses the estimates based on each country’s national definition which means that the data coming from different countries is not directly comparable, but the UN still pools it into one global average.

There is skepticism among some experts about the UN’s method of just taking data from each country since the definitions vary so much. But no matter how you count, it’s clear that our correct answer still stands: as the urban population has been increasing, so too has the rural population.[1]

Experts who find this lack of clear definition problematic are working on new ways to define what’s urban and what’s rural. One suggested method includes satellite imagery, using the density of buildings and density of people as a criteria for determining whether a place is urban or rural.

1720,Rural drinking water access,"Worldwide, how many people in rural areas have access to drinking water within 30 minutes of their home?
",Sources: UNICEF and WHO ,"The data we use comes from UNICEF and the WHO’s Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP). Drinking water access has five classifications (safely managed, basic, limited, unimproved and surface water.) Safely managed and basic are the two categories which do not involve a round trip of more than 30 minutes. In 2020, around 80% of people in rural areas fit into those two categories. Note that people with less than 30 minutes to access water could still only have access to insufficient or unsafe water sources. Access within 30 minutes is only considered as ‘basic water access’. Some experts do not consider this a satisfactory measure with which to say that it is safe. Additionally this data is based on household surveys, the actual access to water could be very different as many spend most of their time outside of the home. Despite those concerns, independent experts we contacted recognized JMP WASH data as the best available.

It was defined in the following way:
“Total debt service is the sum of principal repayments and interest actually paid in currency, goods, or services on long-term debt, interest paid on short-term debt, and repayments (repurchases and charges) to the IMF.”[1]

The underlying data comes from the World Bank’s External Debt Reporting System[3] that aims to capture detailed information at loan level for external borrowing of the reporting countries.

7,How many people in the world live in areas that ar,How many people in the world live in areas that are 5 meters or less above sea level?,Climate Central,"Climate Central[1] estimates that approximately 770 million people in coastal regions worldwide lived at or below an elevation of 5 meters in 2010, which is 11% of the total population of 6.84 billion.[2] This number is higher than the previously popular estimate of 5% in a study by scientists at Columbia University[3]. The higher number is more relevant as it counts people living above the maximum tide levels instead of the average sea level, and it uses more granular population maps and higher accuracy elevation maps. The exact number is still uncertain. There are many sources of potential errors such as people moving around after the populations were counted. Even if nobody knows the exact number we can be sure it’s definitely somewhere around 11% and not nearly as high as most people guessed in our surveys.

It is a well established scientific fact that it takes many years for CO2 (carbon dioxide) to leave the atmosphere. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the most authoritative scientific collaboration about climate change and discusses the time it takes for CO2 to be removed from the atmosphere and how that affects the average global temperature on page 642-643 of the Sixth Assessment Report[1]. The image below is from page 643 of the report and shows how CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and average surface temperature are projected to change in two diffrent scenarios: one with emissions continuing to increase and another with a large cut in emissions.

Someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war or violence. A refugee has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Most likely, they cannot return home or are afraid to do so. War and ethnic, tribal and religious violence are leading causes of refugees fleeing their countries.

UNHCR is the UN refugee agency, considered to have the most reliable refugee data globally and the experts we consulted confirm this fact. 

The figures for Sweden and Germany in this report are based on data reported by governments, non-governmental organizations and UNHCR [1]. UNHCR counts and tracks the numbers of refugees, internally displaced people, people who have returned to their countries or areas of origin, asylum seekers, stateless people and other populations of concern to UNHCR. These data are kept up to date and analyzed in terms of various criteria, such as where people are, their age and whether they are male or female. This process is extremely important in order to meet the needs of refugees and other populations of concern across the world and the data help organizations and states to plan their humanitarian response.

Compared to that energy, how much energy leaves the Earth out into space every year?",Source: IPCC ,"The figures we used for this question come from the IPCC’s sixth assessment report. The figure is calculated in the following way: Of the 340 Wm-2 incoming energy from sunlight, about 100 Wm-2 of is reflected back to space while the Earth emits approximately a further 239 Wm-2 of infrared radiation to space. Therefore, incoming is 340 Wm-2, and outgoing is 239 + 100 = 339 Wm-2. That is about 0.3% less than incoming.

1678,Spending per refugee,"In 2022, many Western European governments spent more than $20 per person per day, to help newly arrived refugees.
How much did the United Nations spend per refugee per day on average, in the rest of the world?
",Source: Various ,"This question compares two spending estimates, calculated by Gapminder, based on data from UNHCR, UNRWA and OECD.
The total spending by the UN is the sum of UNHCR and [UNRWA pledges](https://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/list_of_2022_pledges_by_all_donors.pdf)  reported in 2022, subtracting UNHCR’s spending on internally displaced people (IDP) as they are not international refugees. The UNHCR pledged funding for 2022 (minus 16% for IDP) was $5.2 billion. UNRWA had two sources of income, pledges and [UN core funding to UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/2020-2021_programme_budget_blue_book.pdf) : $1.17 billion + $0.033 bilion = $1.2 billion. This is approximately UN’s total resources to help refugees in 2022: 
$1.2 billion +$5.2 billion =$6.4 billion. We divide this number by the number of refugees and asylum seekers outside Western Europe, 36.6M people (Source UNHCR[3]), to get an average spending per refugee 2022: $6.4B/36.6M = $250/refugee/year. 
Divided by 365, this is $0.48 per refugee per day, which is below $1 a day. In this estimate we include 5.2m Venezuelan migrants, most of whom are not strictly defined as refugees. If we exclude them from the calculation, the figure is $0.68 per refugee per day, which is still far below $1 a day. If we calculate the number only for UNHCR’s activity, and skip UNRWA, the UNHCR alone spent $0.48 per refugee per day.

To estimate the spending by European governments, we used two reports from the OECD: One reports the Aid Money allocated by governments in Western Europe to help refugees within their countries, which in total was $21.6 billion across Europe. For each of the Western European countries we divide their local Aid spending by the sum of Ukrainian refugees and other newly arrived refugees during 2022. The following Western European countries all spent more than $20 per day on newly arrived refugees: Ireland($44), United Kingdom($61), Switzerland($55), Norway($40), Finland($22), Denmark($39), Italy($23), France($47) and Sweden($23). 
The Aid Spending is only part of the public resources spent on refugees, and in some countries it’s a minor part of the total spending.

Therefore we also looked at a second OECD source that estimates the costs of living and the costs of health and education services, per person per day. The right to these services were guaranteed to all Ukrainian refugees, and therefore it can be seen as a proxy for the daily cost, and in all of Western Europe these costs are higher than $20 per person per day.

That is based on the most recent data from all countries. But data from some countries is more reliable than from others. Different countries also use very different criteria for what is a “trained” health worker. To account for this we use the correct option “more than 80%”, to ensure we do not overestimate progress.

Since 2004, we have known how many skilled health workers attend births but not their quality. After 2004, there was an increase in births attended by skilled workers, and even though there was a lot of progress, the decline in maternal mortality didn’t reach the 75% by 2015 that was stated in the Millennium Development Goals (The decrease in maternal mortality ratio from 2000 to 2017 was 38% [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/maternal-mortality)). This was addressed in 2018, with a [newer definition](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272818/WHO-RHR-18.14-eng.pdf?ua=1) of who is a skilled health worker, which has stricter standards. Our data doesn’t yet take this new definition into account as most of the data was collected before 2018. Due to the issue around the definition of “skilled” we tweaked the question to say “trained” health worker instead, as the definition the data uses still meets that criteria.

1509,Literacy rate,How many adults in the world say they can read?,Source: UNESCO,"The data is from UNESCO. Data quality varies between countries and generally it is less reliable in low-income countries. 

The data has been collected using different methodologies in different countries. In some countries the people surveyed are asked if they can read a short text aloud. In many countries, though, people are just asked if they can read or sometimes only if they and the people they live with went to school. There is some evidence from studies that people do not read as well as they report themselves to and that, in some cases, going to school may not mean a person is what we might consider to be literate. These doubts should not stop us recognizing the overall trend, that more boys and girls go to school, men and women have more years of education and more people say they can read than ever before. 

We have put big differences between our three answer options to ensure our correct answer is more correct than the other two.
To check the difference between self-reported literacy and tested literacy, we have found seven studies from different countries that give an idea of roughly the size of the overreporting. In five countries the studies show roughly 12% overreporting of literacy when self-reported: South Africa[3], Nigeria[4], USA[5], India[6] and Bangladesh[7].
The pattern seems to be that countries with lower literacy rates have a larger difference between the self reported number and the tested literacy. In Ghana[8] the difference was 27%, while in Sweden[9] there was almost no difference at all.

1753,Legal slavery in 1950,In how many countries was slavery still legal in 1950? (Meaning there was no law or constitution banning the ownership of another person.),Source: Various via Gapminder,"For this question, we use the earliest year a country adopts a law or constitution or signs an official treaty condemning slavery and/or forced labor of all citizens and guest workers.
(Which doesn't mean the activity stopped in practice!) The fact that law enforcement is not taking enough action to stop it, is a different matter to the one we asked the question about.
We only count the fact that the law is in place, not whether it is enforced, except in three countries where the state itself is reportedly breaking the law, and we find it too hypocritical to classify them as having a state that condemns slavery.
Those are: China, Turkmenistan and North Korea.

The data in the literature uses the live weight of the fish, which  includes the parts that aren’t eaten such as the head and bones. The amount that can actually be eaten is around half that weight, which is why our correct answer is 10kg instead of the 20.5kg in the literature. The beef and veal weight is the retail weight, which is the weight of the meat that is sold for consumption.

The average price of silicon PV modules per Watt, dropped from $20 in 1980 down to $1.4 in 2010. This means the price had dropped to 7% already in 2010. 

The IRENA report[2] shows the levelized cost of electricity expressed in 2020 USD/kWh. It dropped from 0.38 to 0.06 $/kWh. The price in 2020 was 16% of the 2010 price, which was 7% of the 1980 price, which means that the 2020 price was 1% of the 1980 price. These trends are confirmed by these other sources. Data from Lafond et al.[4] and IRENA[2], via Our World in Data[3] shows the global average price of Solar Photovoltaic (PV) modules in 1980 was $35.01 per watt, and in 2019 it was $0.38 per watt. The global average price per watt is measured in 2019 USD. 

The data from Lafond et al.[4] goes up to 2009 and from there Our World in Data used data from the IRENA database[2].

In reality the lower layer (the troposphere) has no exact height after which the upper layer starts. It varies with latitude and season and it’s higher along the equator and lower at the poles. The IPCC reports uses numbers between 9-16km. The upper layer also has no clear end upwards but the evidence here clearly displays that the layer above 12 km up to 50 km altitude has gotten colder, since more heat is now captured in the greenhouse gases in the lower layer. There’s a lot of uncertainty about exactly how large the temperature changes in the two layers have been, depending on what measuring method is being used. But all methods clearly show that the upper layer got colder while the lower got warmer since 1960 when the first measurements started, and we can be even more sure about the results since the 1970s when satellite data started being used.

The data is collected by FAO, using self-reported estimates from the individual countries and measures the share of freshwater withdrawals that go to the agricultural sector, which is estimated to be around 70% worldwide[3]. One caveat with this data is that for some countries the reported estimate is quite old, but it is the latest available.

Freshwater withdrawals is the volume of water removed from a water body. It is then partly consumed/used and partly returned to the same or another water source to be available for future use.
Water consumption on the other hand is just the water that isn’t returned to a water source. Agriculture's share of water consumption is even higher than it is for water withdrawals due to crops and plants losing water through evaporation and transpiration. 

This number includes water withdrawn for irrigation purposes and for livestock watering although, depending on the country, livestock watering sometimes is included in municipal water withdrawal. As far as the water withdrawn for irrigation is concerned, the value far exceeds the consumptive use of irrigation because of water lost in the distribution from the water source to the crops.

Drinking water access has five classifications (safely managed, basic, limited, unimproved and surface water.) Safely managed and basic are the two categories which do not involve a round trip of more than 30 minutes. In 2020, around 90% of people fit into those two categories. Note that people with less than 30 minutes to access water could still only have access to insufficient or unsafe water sources. Access within 30 minutes is only considered as ‘basic water access’. Some experts do not consider this a satisfactory measure with which to say that it is safe. Additionally this data is based on household surveys, the actual access to water could be very different as many spend most of their time outside of the home. Despite those concerns, independent experts we contacted recognized JMP WASH data as the best available.

54,"Of all renewable energy used in the world today, w","Of all renewable energy used in the world today, what share comes from traditional burning of biomass like charcoal, wood and agricultural waste?", Source: Renewables Global Status Report,"
Multiple sources indicate that traditional biofuels are in the range of 40% or more of all renewable energy. According to the RENEWABLES 2019 GLOBAL STATUS REPORT [2], 41% in 2016, with a steady falling trend up to then. We estimate it to be around 35-40% now, according to the most recent RENEWABLES GLOBAL STATUS REPORT from 2021 [1]. These estimates use extrapolations of trends published in IEA, World Energy Balances and Statistics, 2020 edition[6].
Traditional biofuel use is more difficult to estimate than other fuel use, because it is largely firewood or other material gathered by households, and so it doesn’t enter markets where there are more records of how much is being used. 
Nonetheless this data is the best estimate of traditional biofuel usage and is likely an underestimation of the actual use of traditional renewables, as suggested by Smil[3] who assumes the number for 2015 to be approximately 60%. We cross checked these numbers with eight experts in the field and the consensus confirmed our answer.
In addition to the traditional biofuels, the total renewable number here includes wind, solar, hydro and modern bioenergy.

That doesn’t mean that each person has an income of that amount, simply that it is an average. Despite its limitations, it is still the best measure of income that can be used to compare and contrast countries over time. When it comes to the growth in average income in today’s 40 richest countries between 1969 and 2019, there was an increase of 2.6 times. 

The number for “all other countries” is heavily influenced by China because of the size of its population. The average income of all other countries outside the top 40 richest with China was 3.3 times bigger between 1969 and 2019. Without China, they were still 2.3 times bigger. So we can still say that there has been economic development outside the richest countries, even taking away the influence of China.

Up to 40% of shipping is transhipping, which means the container is only stopping temporarily at a port on the way to its destination so, while the port may get some economic benefit, that middle country doesn’t. Some of those containers may even be empty. However, we have found no reason to believe that this differs between middle- and high-income countries. Up until 2012 high-income countries still had more containers than low- and middle-income countries, but it is changing fast with growing economies and growing middle classes in middle-income countries.[1] We consulted three independent experts for this question who had no objection to our correct answer and didn’t dispute that ports in low- and middle-income countries now handle most containers.
The fact that more than 70% of trade goes by boat, comes from UNCTAD[3].

We consulted seven experts for this question, including academics from the [POPGRID data collaborative] (https://www.popgrid.org/) who confirmed that the share of earth’s land built on is less than 5% and probably actually closer to 1%.[2]

The lowest we have seen is 0.5% and that comes from the European Commission’s Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL).[3] It uses satellite imaging technology to measure the built-up area on the Earth’s land. Their global estimation of built up surface share for 2014 was between 0.52% and 0.58% of land mass, depending on if you include Antarctica or not in the global land mass surface. The GHSL uses a strict target semantic - meaning they count only the building footprints, not the surfaces of roads or green areas within an urban settlement. 

It is important to note that this figure of land built on does not take into account all land appropriated for human consumption, such as land used for agriculture, forestry etc. About 10% of all land surface is used for agriculture for human consumption.[4]

In 1985, the British Antarctic Survey discovered the hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica.

The ozone depleting substances that it was aiming to phase down (and eventually out) were discovered to be destructive to ozone in the atmosphere in 1973[3][4]. These substances were mostly Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other molecules that were used in refrigeration and aerosols, amongst other uses. 

The Montreal Protocol has widely been seen as a success and has played a large role in the recently noted recovery of the ozone layer[5]. 
The members also continue to meet and work out new agreements to continue the protection of the ozone layer and reduce the use and production of other substances that have been used in place of the banned ones, that are harmful in other ways[1].

83,Food waste,"Globally, how much food is lost between being harvested and sold in stores?
",Source: The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),"A lot of food loss occurs between harvesting and being sold in stores. Measuring food loss is difficult as there is a big lack of data, and the data that exists is often compiled using different methodologies (do you include the skin of the banana or not?). Most of the food loss takes place in low- or lower-middle-income countries, where crops can be spoiled due to inadequate storage for example, but also where data is more difficult to collect. 

Food that is lost after being sold in stores but is not eaten is called food waste, and is more common in high-income countries. This data is usually of better quality than for food loss, since high-income countries have the resources to measure the waste. It is estimated that in addition to 15% of all food produced being lost between harvest and sale, another 15% of all food is wasted between the store and the consumer.[2] 

The measuring limitations, including the fact that the data is based on rough estimates, are why we put a lot of difference between the three possible answer options. Four independent experts we consulted also agreed that this is best data available for food waste and that our correct answer is more correct than the other two answers.

The UN’s Global Waste Management Outlook [2] is a slightly older report but does not include any commercial waste in their global average of plastic percentage of MSW. It puts plastic as a share of household waste at a slightly lower 10%. 

We checked the correct answer with three independent researchers, two of whom agreed that 12% is correct and a third who directed us to compare with the Global Waste Management Outlook. 

Because waste is hard to measure and the data uncertain, we put big differences between the three options, so that our ‘correct’ answer is ‘more correct’ than any of the other answers.

1760,Material use by income,How much raw material does each person in high-income countries use every year compared to those in middle-income countries?,Source:  UN Stats,"The data on raw materials comes from the UN Statistics division (UN Stats) using the term “material footprint”. It refers to “the total amount of raw materials extracted to meet final consumption demands”. [1] Raw materials include biomass, fossil fuels, metals and non-metallic minerals. 

The number for each country is including imports of raw material, but excluding exports, to count the material use where the consumption is happening. High-income countries for example rely a great deal on extraction of raw materials from other countries (up to 40%), but this is included in their material footprint as imports.

UN Stats gets the data from the International Resource Panel, a global science-policy platform established by the United Nations Environment Programme in 2007 [2]. In their Global Material Flows Database, they have collected data on material flows from The European Union and Japan, while data from all other countries is modelled. [3]

The most recent breakdown by income group only runs to 2017. There are more recent figures available (up to 2019)[4], however, there is no breakdown by income group. That overall data still shows that the trend in global material use has continued. We feel safe to say that “more than 60%” as that is actually the figure for the richer half of the middle-income countries called “upper-middle”-income countries. In those countries people on average use 56% less than high-income. People in the poorer half of middle-income countries, called “lower-middle”-income countries use much less – only 18% of what high-income countries use per person.

1590,Water vapor significance,How does water vapor contribute to the greenhouse effect (which keeps the earth’s atmosphere warm)?,Source: IPCC,"The IPCC[1] lists the primary greenhouse gasses in the earth’s atmosphere as: Water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and ozone (O3). Water vapor stands out among these since its concentration is not determined by emissions but by temperature. When air temperature increases, the atmosphere can hold more water vapor. In IPCC[2] the following quote can be found:

“As the largest contributor to the natural greenhouse effect, water vapour plays an essential role in the Earth’s climate. However the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is controlled mostly by air temperature, rather than by emissions. For that reason, scientists consider it a feedback agent, rather than a forcing to climate change. Anthropogenic emissions of water vapour through irrigation or power plant cooling have a negligible impact on the global climate“

98,Share of wild mammals,"When counting the total body weight of all mammals in the world, roughly how much comes from wild mammals?",Source: The Global Biomass of Wild Mammals (2023),"The original source of this question was a 2018 paper from Yinon M. Bar-On, Rob Phillips, and Ron Milo[2] which estimated the biomass of all living things on earth in gigatons of carbon (Gt C). In total, all mammals on Earth weigh 0.167 gigatons of carbon and of this around 4% came from wild animals, around 36% came from humans, and around 60% came from livestock.

The researchers used various sources and calculated the biomass of each group of mammals by multiplying the carbon stock for a single organism by the number of individuals in that group. For example, for humans, they calculated the average carbon quantity of a person and multiplied that by the human population.

In 2023, another paper was published by Bar-On, Milo and others [1]. This paper estimated the biomass of terrestrial wild mammals at 20 million tonnes and wild marine mammals at 40 million tonnes. In total, they estimated the biomass of all mammals on earth to be around 1.08 billion tonnes. This means wild mammals account for around 5.5% of the biomass of all mammals on Earth. 

There are of course uncertainties in any biomass calculation on this scale. As the researchers highlight in their paper, the largest uncertainties are with marine species and other taxonomies that have smaller and fragmented samples. 

We consulted three independent experts for this question, who all agreed that the source and figures we use are reliable and trusted and we should not hesitate to use them to understand the scale of different mammals’ weight.

99,Farming land use,What share of all agricultural land worldwide is used for feeding animals?,Data: Multiple sources,"Estimating this number is very tricky, as the specific land use is not known for every farm in the world. The first source (Poore & Nemecek)[1] for this estimate is a peer-reviewed study in the journal Science, based on a sample of farms containing more and better data from certain countries and from commercial farms, but almost no data from small farms, which could skew the number either way. 

However, the figure is similar to other sources, including the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) which puts the figure at 80%. [2]

The figure of 83% which we used as the correct answer only considers land used for food, disregarding things like biofuel, cotton and leather. 

The land that animals have to roam and graze on is larger than the amount of land used to grow crops. It is important to realize, though, that not all of that land would be suitable to grow crops on.

100,Forest area,What happened to the global forest area in the last 30 years?,Source: FAO,"We base this on two data sources using very different methods. First, the UN data is mostly based on official statistics reported from the ground. The second source is based on satellite imagery.

The first estimate comes from the latest Global Forest Resources Assessment from the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization FAO [1]. It is a collection of data on forest area, and other land with trees and wooded areas from 1990 to 2020. It estimates that the area covered with trees decreased by 4.2%, between 1990 and 2020.  A tree-covered area is defined as “forest or other areas with a canopy cover of 10% trees that are able to reach 5m in situ”, which includes planted trees and areas that are intended to be replanted. 

The FAO’s estimate for loss of naturally regenerating forest is 8% from 1990 to 2020. This loss of natural forest is somewhat hidden in the total area covered with trees by the increase of, for example, fruit tree plantations, palm oil plantations and olive orchards and trees in urban settings. So while we aren’t losing as many trees as we think, most of the loss is coming from naturally regenerating forests, where biodiversity is usually many times higher than in planted forests

Global Forest Watch is another source of tree cover data [3], which uses satellite imagery instead of on the ground reporting and measures only trees that meet the canopy requirement rather than those that are expected to grow to that height and coverage as well. Its estimate for tree cover from 2001 to 2021 is an 11% decrease. This does not include tree cover gain, which for 2001-2012 (only available years) was 38% of what was lost. 

To avoid underestimating deforestion we chose the largest decrease from the two sources as our correct answer option.

The global figure for 1990 was around 8% and by 2020 it was close to 17%. 

There are limitations with the data: firstly, countries choose which land they decide to protect. This can end up being ‘the land that nobody wants’ that they protect just to meet targets. There’s also no evidence that countries spend any more time, money or effort, conserving this land. 

Despite these issues with it, there are countries where the conservation of the land is being taken seriously. And the six independent experts we consulted for this question agreed that the World Database on Protected Areas that we used is the best source of data on protected land.

The FAO is reliant on data being reported by the countries themselves and so lacks oversight. This means that the definitions of agricultural land can differ between countries. This is more so in data covering African countries and dry Middle Eastern countries where pastures are quite different in nature and intensity. Despite those limitations, three independent experts we consulted agreed that the FAO is the most trustworthy and reliable source and - even though there has likely been a very small increase in agricultural land in the last 50 years - it is still closer to being the same than increasing or decreasing by 50% as we had as our other options.

What is the share today?",Source: UN,"A National Human Rights Institution (NHRI) is an independent administrative body set up by a state to promote and protect human rights. They are supposed to operate independently from the government, but the power that some of these organizations have appears to be variable depending on the country they are in and how answerable they are to their respective governments. Some NHRIs have complaint handling mechanisms but most do not have the power to hand down enforceable, binding orders.

102,Piracy attacks,What happened to the number of pirate attacks on boats worldwide in the last 10 years?,Source: International Maritime Bureau Piracy Reporting Centre ,"The data comes from the IMB Piracy Reporting Centre, which is the authority for piracy reporting data globally. We have also discussed this question with five experts in the field who are in agreement with the use of these findings.

IMB is an independent and non-governmental agency acting as a single point of contact for shipmasters anywhere in the world whose vessels have been attacked or robbed by pirates. There are caveats to the IMB data, however. Attacks and attempted attacks are self-reported and IMB does not collect data in any other way such as crowdsourcing or monitoring seas for attacks. The organization receives the information from ships directly. 

Secondly, attacks and attempted attacks are likely undercounted (ships may not want to report certain attacks or attempted attacks). So, there probably is more sea piracy than is reported to the IMB. It is important to note that there was a spike in piracy attacks between 2009-2011, mostly driven by attacks off the coast of Somalia. If we look at data on hijackings, which are perhaps more likely to be reported than other forms of piracy, the decrease over the past 10 years is still real and sizable.

IMB data for the first quarter of 2023 showed 27 reported incidents, a significant decrease from the 37 reported in the first quarter of 2022[4].

We look at data across 10 years so it gives a better long view of the trend. The figure for deaths we use in the question is for “state-based” conflicts. State-based conflicts are defined as “a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state”. When it comes to the deaths, battle-related deaths are defined as: ”In what can be described as ""normal"" warfare involving the armed forces of the warring parties. This includes traditional battlefield fighting, guerrilla activities (e.g. hit-and-run attacks / ambushes) and all kinds of bombardments of military units, cities and villages etc. The targets are usually the military itself and its installations, or state institutions and state representatives, but there is often substantial collateral damage in the form of civilians killed in crossfire, indiscriminate bombings etc. All deaths - military as well as civilian - incurred in such situations, are counted as battle-related deaths.” These figures do not include the indirect deaths of civilians as a result of war, which include things like disease and famine. Those deaths are typically far more than the numbers of battle deaths.

It defines journalists as “people who cover news or comment on public affairs through any media”. Its figures do not include media workers, which includes people such as translators and fixers. CPJ investigates and verifies the circumstances behind each death and considers it ""confirmed"" as work-related only when reasonably certain that a journalist was murdered in direct reprisal for his or her work; in combat or crossfire; or while carrying out a dangerous assignment. Cases involving unclear motives, but with a potential link to journalism, are classified as ""unconfirmed"". It does not include journalists who are killed in accidents such as car or plane crashes. 
Defining what a journalist is and the reason someone was killed is complex and other sources such as the  [International Federation of Journalists](https://www.ifj.org/what/safety.html) have higher figures than the CPJ, but four independent experts we consulted about this question all said they recognized the CPJ data as reliable and trustworthy – despite it being more conservative than other sources.

1624,Remittances vs aid,"Compared to the total international aid from rich governments in 2022, how much money did migrants across the world transfer back home to their countries of origin?
",Sources: KNOMAD,"This data comes from a report from The Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD)[1], which was established by the World Bank and is funded by multiple governments. The underlying data comes from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators database. 

Measuring large flows of money around the world is difficult and there are of course things which can cause possible over and underestimations. 

The data counts all salaries of UN and embassy employees, as well as non-resident employees of foreign companies. It also includes all money sent by citizens of a country across borders, which means remittances as well as larger sums of money sent by private investors and diaspora members for business investments, property purchase and other financial transactions. Both of these factors can lead to possible overestimations of the amount of remittances. 

On the other hand, not all small transactions conducted using money transfer operators (such as Western Union) and mobile money transfer services are counted in the data. This leads to a probable underestimation of the flow of money that is being sent back to family members from migrants working in other countries. 

Despite the limitations of the data, three independent experts we consulted about this question agreed that the correct answer we use and the source we cite are both valid.

This is a global average so the large differences between regions are hidden. For example, the highest share is 95% in Latin America and the Carribean and the lowest share is 49% in Sub-Saharan Africa. As the variable only counts formal forms of organized education this figure could be an underestimate in some countries.

What is the share today?",Source: UNESCO,"The figure we use for this question is literacy data from UNESCO. Data quality varies between countries and generally it is less reliable in low-income countries. 

The data has been collected using different methodologies in different countries. In some countries the people surveyed are asked if they can read a short text aloud. In many countries, though, people are just asked if they can read or sometimes only if they and the people they live with went to school. There is some evidence from studies that people do not read as well as they report themselves to and that, in some cases, going to school may not mean a person is what we might consider to be literate. These doubts should not stop us recognizing the overall trend, that more boys and girls go to school, men and women have more years of education and more people say they can read than ever before. 

We have put big differences between our three answer options to ensure our correct answer is more correct than the other two.

34,"Worldwide, there are around 38 million people livi","Worldwide, there are around 38 million people living with HIV. How many of them got anti-HIV drugs in 2021?",Source: UNAIDS,"UNAIDS provides estimates  with large uncertainty ranges, since there is a lot of uncertainty in these numbers. In 2021, they estimated the number of people living with HIV to be 38.4 million, with a range of 33.9 million–43.8 million. They estimate around 2 in 10 people don’t know they have HIV. When it comes to the share getting treatment, UNAIDS reported a figure of 75% for 2021, with a range of 66–85%. 

To estimate the total number of people living with HIV, UNAIDS works with countries to develop modelled estimates. Modelled estimates are required because it is impossible to count the exact number of people living with HIV, people who are newly infected with HIV or people who have died from AIDS-related causes in any country. Doing so would require regularly testing every person for HIV and investigating all deaths, which is too costly, difficult and unethical.

We consulted with two independent experts and two epidemiologists working for UNAIDS when investigating the data for this question. We chose “more than 50%” as our correct answer, because of the uncertainty with the data and to avoid overstating progress.

Under-five mortality rate is the probability per 1,000 that a newborn baby will die before reaching age five, if subject to age-specific mortality rates of the specified year.

UN IGME’s preferred source of data is a country’s civil registry system. If there is not a robust enough civil registry system then data from a thorough sample survey is generally used. UNIGME writes in its explanatory notes: “...in the developing world, most countries do not have well-functioning vital registration systems, and household surveys, such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the USAID-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and periodic population censuses have become the primary source of data on under-five and infant mortality in developing countries.”

There is a 90% uncertainty interval in the global estimate we use, which is lower than the usual 95%. Even with the uncertainty, the trend still shows a clear decline in under-5 deaths. The three independent experts we consulted about this question all said they considered the UNIGME estimates to be reliable.

If a person made it past childhood, they are likely to have lived longer than the average age. Still, this is a good measure of the overall health across the world, that of course hides big differences between countries and regions. We compiled these numbers from a number of sources. For the period between 1970-2019, we use the data from IHME’s Global Burden of Disease 2019.

In some of those surveys, the people completing the survey ask to actually see the mosquito nets rather than simply taking a yes or no answer. One thing that may bias results is the season the survey is taking place. People typically use mosquito nets in the rainy season when there are more mosquitos. Also, some countries’ data is out of date and therefore not included in the latest figures. Despite the limitations of the data, there is little doubt that there has been an increase in children using malaria nets over the past couple of decades.  UNICEF has suggested that the Coronavirus pandemic had a big impact on the distribution of bed nets in 2020 and that is likely to have impacted the number of people who caught malaria.

Even in the year 2020 , where we’ve taken into consideration the impact of covid 19, no countries had a life expectancy below 50 years. As uncertainty is higher, we went on and use the estimates of  life expectancy, 95% lower uncertainty bound from IHME to estimate the population in countries where life expectancy is below 50. Using  the 95% lower uncertainty bound  estimates of life expectancy, we found that  only 2 countries (Lesotho and Central African Republic) had a life expectancy below 50 years in 2019. The share of population in these countries was  0.1% of the global population. We have also tested the share of population in countries with life expectancy below 55 years to be able to confirm this fact. Four countries were in this category, with a population share of 0.3%. Based on different scenerios, we can confirm that the share of world population that live in countries where life expectancy is shorter than 50 years range from 0 to 1%, but not more that.

These sources use slightly different data but support the same large increase in the poorest countries. They are based on numbers from population censuses and different health surveys.

The data we use are for 2017, as there is a delay of a number of years between data collection, analysis and publication. This data is not collected annually (usually once every 10 years or so) and, as such, some of the countries’ figures may be slightly outdated. If data were available for every country for this year it is quite likely the average life expectancy would be even higher. A number of low-income countries in 1970 are no longer low-income countries, so if we were to compare the countries over time the change in life-expectancy would be even greater.

The low rate of employment amongst South Sudanese refugees in the camp in 2017 is partly due to their more recent arrival to Kakuma, in general.

447,"Worldwide, 28% of people are e","Worldwide, 28% of people are employed in the agricultural sector. What is this figure in Italy?",Source: ILO,"This question refers to the share of people working in agriculture who are of working age. The census data often used by the ILO is collected every 5-10 years so is not always very current. The quality of data obviously varies by country, with one particular issue being that in some countries it only covers employees and so doesn't include those who are self-employed and unpaid family workers. In those cases, the employment share of the agricultural sector is likely severely underreported. Another issue is where the census data only includes people in urban areas. Where the data is like those two, we do not ask questions about those countries. We also put big differences between the answer options so that our correct answer is way more correct than the other options.

121,Rwa trained health worker ,"In Rwanda, how many babies are born with a trained health worker present (before the pandemic)?",UNICEF,"This data is complied by the World Health Organization and Unicef. The number we use is based on the most recent data. Data from some countries is more reliable than from others. Different countries also use very different criteria for what is a “trained” health worker. To account for this we use the correct option “more than” rather than using a specific number, to ensure we do not overestimate progress. Since 2004, we have known how many skilled health workers attend births but not their quality. After 2004, there was an increase in births attended by skilled workers, and even though there was a lot of progress, the decline in maternal mortality didn’t reach the 75% by 2015 that was stated in the Millennium Development Goals (The decrease in maternal mortality ratio from 2000 to 2017 was 38%. This was addressed in 2018, with a newer definition of who is a skilled health worker, which has stricter standards. Our data doesn’t yet take this new definition into account as most of the data was collected before 2018. Due to the issue around the definition of “skilled” we tweaked the question to say “trained” health worker instead, as the definition the data uses still meets that criteria.

What is that figure?,NATO via Gapminder,"NATO is funded by contributions in different forms from its member countries. There are three main NATO budgets, the civil budget, military budget and the NATO Security Investment Programme. 

NATO Defense ministers decided in 2006 to set a commitment of contributing 2% of their countries GDP to defense spending. 

This 2% threshold is not met by every country each year, however. In 2014, member countries who were currently meeting the 2% guideline agreed to continue to try to meet it and those who were below the 2% of GDP spending agreed to halt any decline and aim to increase their defense spending until they hit the 2% threshold. 

These commitments have been followed it seems as in 2022 was ""the eighth consecutive year of rising defence spending across European Allies and Canada, amounting to a rise of 2.2% in real terms compared to 2021.""[1]

The scores and ranking take into account data from the previous calendar year but they do adjust the scores throughout the year in the event of significant changes in the press freedom in a country. This includes things such as a new war, a coup, major attacks on journalists or other similar events. 

In July 2023 Myanmar had a score of 28.26 and ranked 173 out of 180 countries.

In the past there has been criticisms of the Reporters without Borders World Press Freedom Index and The Freedom House Freedom of the Press report[2], another similar index that started in 1978 and stopped in 2017. 
Most of the criticisms are summarized in this article[3] and some Myanmar specific concerns were raised in 2013 concerning the Freedom House Index[4]. 

Despite these criticisms, experts we spoke to and published articles on the subject acknowledge that this is currently the best attempt at quantifying and ranking press freedoms between countries. 
The Reporters without Borders methodology has also changed and adapted since these criticisms were published, to add more questions and attempt to address blind spots in the methodology.

They found that, at that time, 58% of US children participated in online learning. Of those, 10.1 percent did not have adequate access to the Internet or a computer or other electronic device used for educational purposes. A second paper[2] from a different group of academics, using a different source found roughly the same results, including the differences according to the education and race/ethnicity of the child's parents. The share of children who did not have the required technology decreased as the pandemic continued, which means our correct answer is still way more correct than the other two answer options.

The data is taken from nationally representative household surveys which are done infrequently (typically every 3 to 5 years). An issue when it comes to dangerous underweight is that it is an acute illness that can change frequently and quickly over the course of a year. As such, there is unreliability in the estimates and that is why we built in big differences between our three answer options. No matter how things change throughout a year 2020, a correct answer around 7% or 8%, is much more correct than the other two answer options. We gathered feedback from three independent experts who confirmed this.

Obesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 30 (overweight is a BMI greater than or equal to 25). BMI has its critics as, for example, people who are extremely muscular and therefore very heavy for their height may be defined as obese. However, it is currently the best measure of obesity that allows for comparison among a population. The figures used by the WHO come from the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration which created obesity estimates using population studies of more than 100 million participants and whose findings were published in the Lancet medical journal[4].

In tertiary education the share of female academics may vary largely between countries in different income groups. When looking at this data, it is important to consider that there is a difference between full time and part time positions and gender. This data includes both full and part time. One independent expert we spoke to suggested that it is more common for men to get full time academic positions. Also, measuring the share does however not say anything about quality of education or the different conditions for female academics.

Since 2004, we have known how many skilled health workers attend births but not their quality. After 2004, there was an increase in births attended by skilled workers, and even though there was a lot of progress, the decline in maternal mortality didn’t reach the 75% mark by 2015 that was stated in the Millennium Development Goals (The decrease in maternal mortality ratio from 2000 to 2017 was 38%.

1549,stunted in SSA,"Worldwide, 22% of children are much shorter than average because they’ve had too little food sometime during their first five years of life. What is that number in Sub-Saharan Africa?","Sources: WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank","The prevalence of stunting (low height for age) was 22% globally in 2020, while in Sub-Saharan Africa it was 32% in the same year. A child is considered to be stunted if their height-for-age is more than two standard deviations below the WHO Child Growth Standards median. Despite the prevalence of stunting going down, the actual number of children who are stunted in Sub-Saharan Africa has actually increased due to the increasing population of children. 
The data is taken from nationally representative household surveys which are done infrequently (typically every 3 to 5 years). As the WHO itself says in the methodology, the figures measure malnutrition at one point in time (e.g. during one or several months of field work). Since stunting is relatively stable over
the course of a calendar year, it is reasonable to track changes over time with this data.
Despite the limitations of the data, the three independent experts we asked about the data from the Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates did not object to using the data and often use it themselves to show measures of hunger among children.

Also, a trained teacher is not necessarily the same as a qualified teacher. Plus, national standards regarding teacher qualifications and pedagogical skills may vary. This means estimates are dependent on the policy of each country and affect the final number.  The variable does not take into account the varying experience and status of teachers or how they were trained and what they have at their disposal when teaching (materials, classroom conditions etc) which are all factors that affect the quality of teaching and learning.

Also, a trained teacher is not necessarily the same as a qualified teacher. Plus, national standards regarding teacher qualifications and pedagogical skills may vary. This means estimates are dependent on the policy of each country and affect the final number.  The variable does not take into account the varying experience and status of teachers or how they were trained and what they have at their disposal when teaching (materials, classroom conditions etc) which are all factors that affect the quality of teaching and learning. Finally, some teachers without formal training may have acquired equivalent pedagogical skills through professional experience.

Since 2004, we have known how many skilled health workers attend births but not their quality.

Our data doesn’t yet take this new definition into account as most of the data was collected before 2018.

This is based on national accounts data which is of poorer quality in poorer countries where the informal sector is larger. Over the last 200 years, most countries increased their incomes and as they did they have followed very similar declines of agriculture as a share of their economies. It’s hard to know exactly what the global percentage was at the start of the industrial revolution, but probably around 50%. That’s where a few extremely poor countries still are today.

It has been collected using different methodologies in different countries. In some countries the people surveyed are asked if they can read a short text aloud. In many countries, though, people are just asked if they can read or sometimes only if they and the people they live with went to school. There is some evidence from studies that people do not read as well as they report themselves to and that, in some cases, going to school may not mean a person is what we might consider to be literate. These doubts should not stop us recognizing the overall trend, that more mem, women and children have more years of education and more people say they can read than ever before.

Civicus says of its methodology: ""The CIVICUS Monitor combines data from a range of sources. Through a series of standard calculations and verification checks, we produce a guiding score for each country that we use to assign ratings on the state of civic space. Civic space is defined as the respect in law and practice for the freedoms of association, peaceful assembly and expression. Built into each of the three core freedoms is the understanding that a state has a duty to protect civil society, and must go beyond simply refraining from interfering in citizens' enjoyment of their rights."" To ensure that we are not misrepresnting the freedoms of a country we also double check the Civicus rating with other sources.

466,Of all the primary school teac,"Of all the primary school teachers in Kiribati, how many have had teacher training?",Source: UNESCO,"The data we use for this question comes from UNESCO. When it comes to issues around this data, one is that there is no global definition for what constitutes an academically trained teacher so each country has a slightly different definition. Also, a trained teacher is not necessarily the same as a qualified teacher. Plus, national standards regarding teacher qualifications and pedagogical skills may vary. This means estimates are dependent on the policy of each country and affect the final number.  The variable does not take into account the varying experience and status of teachers or how they were trained and what they have at their disposal when teaching (materials, classroom conditions etc) which are all factors that affect the quality of teaching and learning. Finally, some teachers without formal training may have acquired equivalent pedagogical skills through professional experience. Despite these concerns, three independent experts we contacted say they trust this data. We also try to counter these caveats by putting large differences between the answer options.

The number we use is based on the most recent data. Data from some countries is more reliable than from others. Different countries also use very different criteria for what is a “trained” health worker. To account for this we use the correct option “more than” rather than using a specific number, to ensure we do not overestimate progress. Since 2004, we have known how many skilled health workers attend births but not their quality. After 2004, there was an increase in births attended by skilled workers, and even though there was a lot of progress, the decline in maternal mortality didn’t reach the 75% by 2015 that was stated in the Millennium Development Goals (The decrease in maternal mortality ratio from 2000 to 2017 was 38%. This was addressed in 2018, with a newer definition of who is a skilled health worker, which has stricter standards. Our data doesn’t yet take this new definition into account as most of the data was collected before 2018. Due to the issue around the definition of “skilled” we tweaked the question to say “trained” health worker instead, as the definition the data uses still meets that criteria.

Some countries’ numbers may be overestimates and others are underestimates, for example there is often an underrepresentation of rural communities where Internet access might be lower, resulting in our number being an overestimation. On the other hand, data can be slow to come in from low-income settings where progress right now is the fastest, and the number we have might therefore also be an underestimation. Finally, the ITU’s definition of using the Internet as being online once in the previous three months. If someone was only online once or twice in that time, that is clearly very different from the constant connection many of us have.

Different countries also use very different criteria for what is a “trained” health worker. To account for this we use the correct option “more than” rather than using a specific number, to ensure we do not overestimate progress. Since 2004, we have known how many skilled health workers attend births but not their quality. After 2004, there was an increase in births attended by skilled workers, and even though there was a lot of progress, the decline in maternal mortality didn’t reach the 75% by 2015 that was stated in the Millennium Development Goals (The decrease in maternal mortality ratio from 2000 to 2017 was 38%. This was addressed in 2018, with a newer definition of who is a skilled health worker, which has stricter standards. Our data doesn’t yet take this new definition into account as most of the data was collected before 2018. Due to the issue around the definition of “skilled” we tweaked the question to say “trained” health worker instead, as the definition the data uses still meets that criteria.

The Red List uses a variety of criteria to assess the threatened status of a species, and focuses on the worst-case scenario, potentially overestimating the level of threat. The criteria are somewhat subjective and the decisions are secretive and in some cases there are political motivations to listing a species as more or less threatened than it is.

It is important to recognize that the UNESCO system of designating world heritage sites is not without controversy. Firstly, there are accustions of favoritism and that poorer countries struggle to have their sites recognized due to a lack of expertize. Next, there is an accusation that it can be used to profit from people's heritage and resources in a way that excludes them. Those issues aside, it is clear that in the right hands (i.e., historic and cultural preservation organizations, and indigenous community development organizations.) the recognition of these sites can be used as a force for good to bring more opportunity for economically depressed communities.

Since 2004, we have known how many skilled health workers attend births but not their quality. After 2004, there was an increase in births attended by skilled workers, and even though there was a lot of progress, the decline in maternal mortality didn’t reach the 75% by 2015 that was stated in the Millennium Development Goals (The decrease in maternal mortality ratio from 2000 to 2017 was 38%. This was addressed in 2018, with a newer definition of who is a skilled health worker, which has stricter standards. Our data doesn’t yet take this new definition into account as most of the data was collected before 2018. Due to the issue around the definition of “skilled” we tweaked the question to say “trained” health worker instead, as the definition the data uses still meets that criteria.

Since 2004, we have known how many skilled health workers attend births but not their quality. After 2004, there was an increase in births attended by skilled workers, and even though there was a lot of progress, the decline in maternal mortality didn’t reach the 75% by 2015 that was stated in the Millennium Development Goals (The decrease in maternal mortality ratio from 2000 to 2017 was 38%.

Some countries’ numbers may be overestimates and others are underestimates, for example there is often an underrepresentation of rural communities where Internet access might be lower, resulting in our number being an overestimation. On the other hand, data can be slow to come in from low-income settings where progress right now is the fastest, and the number we have might therefore also be an underestimation. Finally, the ITU’s definition of using the Internet as being online once in the previous three months. If someone was only online once or twice in that time, that is clearly very different from the constant connection many of us have.

When it comes to issues around this data, one is that there is no global definition for what constitutes an academically trained teacher so each country has a slightly different definition. Also, a trained teacher is not necessarily the same as a qualified teacher. Plus, national standards regarding teacher qualifications and pedagogical skills may vary. This means estimates are dependent on the policy of each country and affect the final number.  The variable does not take into account the varying experience and status of teachers or how they were trained and what they have at their disposal when teaching (materials, classroom conditions etc) which are all factors that affect the quality of teaching and learning. Finally, some teachers without formal training may have acquired equivalent pedagogical skills through professional experience.

Different countries also use very different criteria for what is a “trained” health worker. To account for this we use the correct option “more than” rather than using a specific number, to ensure we do not overestimate progress. Since 2004, we have known how many skilled health workers attend births but not their quality. After 2004, there was an increase in births attended by skilled workers, and even though there was a lot of progress, the decline in maternal mortality didn’t reach the 75% by 2015 that was stated in the Millennium Development Goals (The decrease in maternal mortality ratio from 2000 to 2017 was 38%. This was addressed in 2018, with a newer definition of who is a skilled health worker, which has stricter standards. Our data doesn’t yet take this new definition into account as most of the data was collected before 2018. Due to the issue around the definition of “skilled” we tweaked the question to say “trained” health worker instead, as the definition the data uses still meets that criteria.

It does exclude trees that are in agriculture production systems and in urban parks and gardens. 
There are two main ways to measure forested area, via satellite imaging and on the ground reporting. The FAO incorporates a small amount of satellite imaging into their work but almost all of their data comes from on the ground data collection that is self reported by individual countries to the FAO. 
It is important to realize that this data does not take into account the quality of the forest or whether it is an old, untouched primary forest or a regrowing stand of trees where an old biodiverse forest once stood. 
Measuring the amount of forest in any country is a difficult task and while there are uncertainties and different approaches, independent experts we asked agreed that this is the correct data to be using for country level forest data.

We chose to have an average across both chambers of parliament despite the upper houses having different levels of power in different countries.

They have a set of criteria but whether they are actually determinants and how they are assessed are questioned by independent experts we contacted. A concern raised by one was that a whole city does not have to be part of the initiative, only a part of it like a municipality. The data collection and monitoring is different in different parts of the world. Additionally in some cases it may only be a matter of calling themselves child friendly, the label does not necessarily reflect the reality for the children living there. Another issue is that being part of the initiative might require some collaboration with UNICEF. There is however no other comparative measure when it comes to child friendly cities so this is the best one out there. UNICEF is seen as a reliable and trusted source by the experts.

Since 2004, we have known how many skilled health workers attend births but not their quality. After 2004, there was an increase in births attended by skilled workers, and even though there was a lot of progress, the decline in maternal mortality didn’t reach the 75% by 2015 that was stated in the Millennium Development Goals (The decrease in maternal mortality ratio from 2000 to 2017 was 38%. This was addressed in 2018, with a newer definition of who is a skilled health worker, which has stricter standards. Our data doesn’t yet take this new definition into account as most of the data was collected before 2018. Due to the issue around the definition of “skilled” we tweaked the question to say “trained” health worker instead, as the definition the data uses still meets that criteria.

It is compiled through surveys and, where data is missing, from estimates. Some countries’ numbers may be overestimates and others are underestimates, for example there is often an underrepresentation of rural communities where Internet access might be lower, resulting in our number being an overestimation. On the other hand, data can be slow to come in from low-income settings where progress right now is the fastest, and the number we have might therefore also be an underestimation. Finally, the ITU’s definition of using the Internet as being online once in the previous three months. If someone was only online once or twice in that time, that is clearly very different from the constant connection many of us have. Despite these limitations, two independent experts we consulted considered the ITU’s figures the best and most reliable estimate of how many people use the Internet.

When it comes to issues around this data, one is that there is no global definition for what constitutes an academically trained teacher so each country has a slightly different definition. Also, a trained teacher is not necessarily the same as a qualified teacher. Plus, national standards regarding teacher qualifications and pedagogical skills may vary. This means estimates are dependent on the policy of each country and affect the final number.  The variable does not take into account the varying experience and status of teachers or how they were trained and what they have at their disposal when teaching (materials, classroom conditions etc) which are all factors that affect the quality of teaching and learning. Finally, some teachers without formal training may have acquired equivalent pedagogical skills through professional experience. Despite these concerns, three independent experts we contacted say they trust this data. We also try to counter these caveats by putting large differences between the answer options.

Over the last 200 years, most countries increased their incomes and as they did they have followed very similar declines of agriculture as a share of their economies.

Different countries also use very different criteria for what is a “trained” health worker. To account for this we use the correct option “more than” rather than using a specific number, to ensure we do not overestimate progress. Since 2004, we have known how many skilled health workers attend births but not their quality. After 2004, there was an increase in births attended by skilled workers, and even though there was a lot of progress, the decline in maternal mortality didn’t reach the 75% by 2015 that was stated in the Millennium Development Goals (The decrease in maternal mortality ratio from 2000 to 2017 was 38%. This was addressed in 2018, with a newer definition of who is a skilled health worker, which has stricter standards. Our data doesn’t yet take this new definition into account as most of the data was collected before 2018. Due to the issue around the definition of “skilled” we tweaked the question to say “trained” health worker instead, as the definition the data uses still meets that criteria.

It has been collected using different methodologies in different countries. In some countries the people surveyed are asked if they can read a short text aloud. In many countries, though, people are just asked if they can read or sometimes only if they and the people they live with went to school. There is some evidence from studies that people do not read as well as they report themselves to and that, in some cases, going to school may not mean a person is what we might consider to be literate. These doubts should not stop us recognizing the overall trend, that more mem, women and children have more years of education and more people say they can read than ever before. 
We have put big differences between our three answer options to ensure our correct answer is more correct than the other two.

Since 2004, we have known how many skilled health workers attend births but not their quality. After 2004, there was an increase in births attended by skilled workers, and even though there was a lot of progress, the decline in maternal mortality didn’t reach the 75% by 2015 that was stated in the Millennium Development Goals (The decrease in maternal mortality ratio from 2000 to 2017 was 38%. This was addressed in 2018, with a newer definition of who is a skilled health worker, which has stricter standards. Our data doesn’t yet take this new definition into account as most of the data was collected before 2018.

Since 2004, we have known how many skilled health workers attend births but not their quality. After 2004, there was an increase in births attended by skilled workers, and even though there was a lot of progress, the decline in maternal mortality didn’t reach the 75% by 2015 that was stated in the Millennium Development Goals (The decrease in maternal mortality ratio from 2000 to 2017 was 38%. This was addressed in 2018, with a newer definition of who is a skilled health worker, which has stricter standards. Our data doesn’t yet take this new definition into account as most of the data was collected before 2018. Due to the issue around the definition of “skilled” we tweaked the question to say “trained” health worker instead, as the definition the data uses still meets that criteria.

Civic space is defined as the respect in law and practice for the freedoms of association, peaceful assembly and expression. Built into each of the three core freedoms is the understanding that a state has a duty to protect civil society, and must go beyond simply refraining from interfering in citizens' enjoyment of their rights."" To ensure that we are not misrepresnting the freedoms of a country we also double check the Civicus rating with other sources.

When it comes to issues around this data, one is that there is no global definition for what constitutes an academically trained teacher so each country has a slightly different definition. Also, a trained teacher is not necessarily the same as a qualified teacher. Plus, national standards regarding teacher qualifications and pedagogical skills may vary. This means estimates are dependent on the policy of each country and affect the final number.  The variable does not take into account the varying experience and status of teachers or how they were trained and what they have at their disposal when teaching (materials, classroom conditions etc) which are all factors that affect the quality of teaching and learning. Finally, some teachers without formal training may have acquired equivalent pedagogical skills through professional experience.

Different countries also use very different criteria for what is a “trained” health worker. To account for this we use the correct option “more than” rather than using a specific number, to ensure we do not overestimate progress. Since 2004, we have known how many skilled health workers attend births but not their quality. After 2004, there was an increase in births attended by skilled workers, and even though there was a lot of progress, the decline in maternal mortality didn’t reach the 75% by 2015 that was stated in the Millennium Development Goals (The decrease in maternal mortality ratio from 2000 to 2017 was 38%. This was addressed in 2018, with a newer definition of who is a skilled health worker, which has stricter standards. Our data doesn’t yet take this new definition into account as most of the data was collected before 2018. Due to the issue around the definition of “skilled” we tweaked the question to say “trained” health worker instead, as the definition the data uses still meets that criteria.

628,"In Pakistan in 2020, how many ","In Pakistan in 2020, how many babies were born with a trained health worker present?",Source: UNICEF,"This data is complied by the World Health Organization and Unicef. The number we use is based on the most recent data. Data from some countries is more reliable than from others. Different countries also use very different criteria for what is a “trained” health worker. To account for this we use the correct option “more than” rather than using a specific number, to ensure we do not overestimate progress. Since 2004, we have known how many skilled health workers attend births but not their quality. After 2004, there was an increase in births attended by skilled workers, and even though there was a lot of progress, the decline in maternal mortality didn’t reach the 75% by 2015 that was stated in the Millennium Development Goals (The decrease in maternal mortality ratio from 2000 to 2017 was 38%. This was addressed in 2018, with a newer definition of who is a skilled health worker, which has stricter standards. Our data doesn’t yet take this new definition into account as most of the data was collected before 2018. Due to the issue around the definition of “skilled” we tweaked the question to say “trained” health worker instead, as the definition the data uses still meets that criteria.

627,"During the past 5 years, women","During the past 5 years, women held 25% of all seats in national parliaments worldwide. What was the number in Pakistan?",Source: IPU,"Our correct figure is an average across both lower and upper chambers of parliament between 2017-2022. This figure will change as elections are held. We chose to have an average across both chambers of parliament despite the upper houses having different levels of power in different countries. It’s worth noting that being represented in the parliament does not automatically transfer into female contribution and engagement as there sometimes can be other obstacles.
We consulted six independent experts for this question who all agreed that the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) data is extremely reliable.

626,Of all the primary school teac,"Of all the primary school teachers in Pakistan, how many have had teacher training?",Source: UNESCO,"The data we use for this question comes from UNESCO. When it comes to issues around this data, one is that there is no global definition for what constitutes an academically trained teacher so each country has a slightly different definition. Also, a trained teacher is not necessarily the same as a qualified teacher. Plus, national standards regarding teacher qualifications and pedagogical skills may vary. This means estimates are dependent on the policy of each country and affect the final number.  The variable does not take into account the varying experience and status of teachers or how they were trained and what they have at their disposal when teaching (materials, classroom conditions etc) which are all factors that affect the quality of teaching and learning. Finally, some teachers without formal training may have acquired equivalent pedagogical skills through professional experience. Despite these concerns, three independent experts we contacted say they trust this data. We also try to counter these caveats by putting large differences between the answer options.
