## Key Insights

### Distribution of Agreement Types

| Agreement Level | Correct | Wrong | Very Wrong | Indecisive | Total |
|----------------|---------|-------|------------|------------|-------|
| Perfect (100%) | 23 | 0 | 0 | 12 | 35 |
| Strong (80-99%) | 12 | 0 | 1 | 20 | 33 |
| Low (<80%) | 8 | 5 | 3 | 14 | 30 |
| Total | 43 | 5 | 4 | 46 | 98 |

### Analysis

1. **Types of Questions with High Consensus**:
   - Climate and environment questions (CO2 emissions, global warming, atmospheric effects)
   - Basic global demographic statistics (population trends, unemployment rates)
   - Economic indicators (poverty, global income distribution)
   - Questions about global trends with established scientific consensus have high agreement rates
   - Questions with clearly defined metrics or classifications show stronger model consensus

2. **Questions Where Models Consistently Show Low Consensus**:
   - Regional comparisons requiring specific contextual knowledge (e.g., Q3: food insecurity in Africa)
   - Future projections and forecasts (e.g., Q1: future poverty trends in Africa)
   - Complex economic questions about developing regions (e.g., Q26, Q27)
   - Topics where training data might be outdated or conflicting (e.g., Q7: recent undernourishment trends)
   - Questions requiring nuanced understanding of social factors (e.g., Q10: overweight in rich countries)

3. **Indecisive Answer Analysis**:
   - 46 out of 98 questions (47%) show indecisive responses as the most common outcome
   - Questions about regional statistics for low and middle-income countries are frequently indecisive
   - Technical topics with specific numeric values often lead to indecisive results (e.g., patent applications, waste management)
   - Questions requiring precise quantitative comparisons across regions show high indecisiveness
   - This suggests models struggle with confidence when exact values are required for less documented regions

4. **Impact of Consensus on Correctness**:
   - High consensus does not always correlate with correctness
   - 23 questions with perfect agreement were correct, but none were wrong or very wrong
   - Strong agreement (80-99%) shows more variation in correctness
   - The presence of indecisive responses in high-consensus questions suggests models appropriately express uncertainty

5. **Implications**:
   - Models show strongest consensus on well-established global facts and scientifically accepted phenomena
   - Lower consensus on regional comparisons suggests potential knowledge gaps about specific regions
   - The high rate of indecisive responses indicates models may be calibrated to express uncertainty rather than make confident errors
   - For applications requiring regional expertise, models may need supplementary training or knowledge sources
   - When multiple models agree, they are more likely to be correct than wrong, suggesting ensemble approaches may improve reliability
