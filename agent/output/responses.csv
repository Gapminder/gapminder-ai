Worldwide, **Around 60%** of people living in rural areas have a toilet that they don't have to share with other households.

**Reasoning:**
The document explicitly states that ""Around 60%"" is the CORRECT answer to the question: ""Worldwide, how many people living in rural areas have a toilet that they don\'t have to share with other households?"" The ""Correct Sentence Text"" further confirms this: ""Globally, around 60% of people living in rural areas have a toilet they don't have to share with other households.""

The document also notes that people often underestimate this figure, thinking fewer rural households have private toilets. The data comes from the WHO & UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP).",correct,
"I was asked this question:
What share of all energy used in the world comes from the modern renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro and modern biofuels)?
The answer could be: Less than 10%
or: Around 20%
or maybe the answer is
Around 35%
I really don't know.
Please help guess, and also describe why you think so.","Based on the document ""q1696 - Modern renewable share.md"", the answer is:

**Less than 10%**

**Here's why:**

*   The document ""q1696 - Modern renewable share.md"" directly addresses this question. It states that **""Around 5% all energy used in the world comes from modern renewable sources.""** This falls into the ""Less than 10%"" category.
*   The extended answer in that document clarifies a common point of confusion: ""The share of energy from solar, wind, hydro and modern biofuels has been growing, but not as much as people imagine. When it comes to electricity, nearly 40% comes from modern renewables. Perhaps that is why people assume that the share of total energy from renewables is higher. What most people don't realize, though, is that electricity is only 20% of all the energy used in the world.""

Other documents provide context:
*   ""q1628 - world energy consumption sources.md"" indicates that about 82% of all energy comes from fossil fuels (natural gas, coal, and oil). This leaves about 18% for all non-fossil sources combined.
*   ""q3053 - Non-fossil use.md"" confirms that around 18% of all energy used in 2022 came from non-fossil fuel sources.
*   ""q1627 - nuclear as share of energy.md"" states that nuclear energy accounts for around 4-5% of all primary energy.

So, if non-fossil sources are about 18%, and nuclear is about 5%, then all renewables (traditional and modern) would account for roughly 13% of total energy. The document ""q1696 - Modern renewable share.md"" specifies that *modern* renewables make up about 5% of the total energy used.",correct,

*   The ""Correct Sentence Text"" is: ""Globally, around 30% of companies are partially owned by women.""
*   The data comes from the World Bank Enterprise Survey, which is based on interviews with tens of thousands of businesses in 144 countries between 2005 and 2021.
*   The document also mentions that ""Women's influence in business has been steadily increasing. But instead the negative picture is maintained that almost no women are in power, which can be self reinforcing as it may discourage young women from pursuing a career in business.""

"I was asked this question:
If we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, for how long would the sea level continue to rise?

The answer could be: About 10 years
or: About 100 years
or maybe the answer is
Over 1,000 years
I really don't know.
Please help guess, and also describe why you think so.","Based on the document ""q1465 - greehouse gases and sea levels.md"":

The answer is **Over 1,000 years**.

**Why:**
The document states: ""If we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, the sea level would continue to rise for more than 1,000 years.""
The source for this information is the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), specifically their Sixth Assessment Report.

The reason sea levels would continue to rise for such a long time even if emissions stopped is due to several factors:
1.  **Thermal Expansion:** Oceans have absorbed a vast amount of heat due to past and current greenhouse gas emissions. Water expands as it warms, and this process is slow and will continue for centuries even if atmospheric warming stops.
2.  **Ice Sheet Melt:** Large ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica respond very slowly to temperature changes. Even if warming stopped, the heat already in the system would continue to melt these ice sheets for centuries to millennia, contributing to sea-level rise.
3.  **Deep Ocean Warming:** Heat takes a long time to penetrate into the deep ocean. As this deeper water warms, it will also expand.

Therefore, the climate system has a lot of inertia, and the consequences of past emissions, particularly for sea level rise, will be felt for a very long time.",correct,
"I was asked this question:
In 2000, low- and middle-income countries on average spent almost 6% of their annual income on their government's loans. What was this number in 2022?
The answer could be: Around 4%

Around 12%
I really don't know.
Please help guess, and also describe why you think so.","Based on the document ""q1858 - Loans spending.md"", the answer is likely **Around 4%**.

*   The document states: ""In 2000, low- and middle-income countries on average spent 5.7% of their annual income on their loans. What was this number in 2019?""
*   The correct answer for 2019 is listed as ""Around 4%"".
*   The ""Actual"" field clarifies: ""In 2019, low- and middle-income countries spent 3.9% of their gross national income on debt service payments.""
*   The ""Expanded"" section notes: ""Since 2000, through various efforts from organizations like the World Bank and the IMF, these countries have been able to pay a smaller share of their income in debt service payments...""

Given that the figure was 3.9% in 2019 and the trend has been a decrease in the share of income spent on loan repayments since 2000, it is most plausible that the figure for 2022 would remain around 4%, rather than increasing significantly to 8% or 12%.",correct,

Here's why:
*   Different sources estimate the direct share of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation to be between 2% and 4%.
*   Some experts suggest that because these emissions are released at a higher altitude, their effect on climate change might be greater, putting the figure between 4% and 5%.
*   However, no sources cited in the document place the figure above 5%. Therefore, ""less than 6%"" is considered the correct answer, which is still significantly lower than what many people might guess.
*   The document further clarifies that aviation's share of greenhouse gas emissions is closer to 3.5%.

Additionally, the document ""q2673 – GHG emissions from transport.md"" states that all forms of transport combined account for around 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions.
