# Cline Rules for the Gapminder AI Project

## Before Starting a Task
1. Always read the README.md file first to understand the project structure and setup requirements
2. We use `uv` for Python package management instead of pip
   - Install packages with: `uv pip install <package>`
   - Install from requirements.txt: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Environment
- Use Python version specified in .python-version
- Always work within the virtual environment
- Keep requirements.txt updated when adding new dependencies

## Code Quality
1. We use pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
   - Run `pre-commit install` to set up the hooks
   - Hooks will run automatically on git commit
   - You can also run manually with `pre-commit run --all-files`
