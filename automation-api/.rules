 # General Rules for Automation API

 - when start a task, try to find if there are related items in backlogs. Read them to know the current status about the project.
 - if no related items found. Plan your action and create the plan in backlogs/
 - An item in backlogs/ should have 2 sections:
   1. the plan
   2. summarization of each edit session about what has been done.
 - after a task is done, update the backlog and README.md/DEV.md in the project folder. (automation_api/README.md / automation_api/DEV.md)
 - at current stage, don't keep backward compatibility, breaking changes are fine.

# How to test the gm-eval command
- Remind me (the human user) about I should update the configuration speadsheet before start.
- create a temp folder in project root
- in the temp folder, run `gm-eval download` and then `gm-eval run`
